# AlphabetSoup
This is an in-class project I did in my first year of computer science coursework. Going to try refine it and potentially build upon it.

## How to run it
Download the alphabetSoup.jar file located in the currentJar directory and run it like any executable file.

Requires Java SE Runtime (version 22) to run. (Older versions may work but confirmed working on 22).

## Acknowledgement
I wrote most of the logic for the game, but I did not write the UI code and some other things. What I did not write was provided by the professor for this class. I will look through and verify what was written by me and what was provided (it's been a while since I touched this project).

I am currently trying to understand the UI elements and plan to add a menu and options screens to configure aspects of the game.

## TODO
 - Write this todo list
 - Add screenshots
 - List what was written by me and what was provided by the professor
